## About 
Project Sticky is an app inspired by the need for project management. By the name project sticky, we hope people can stick to the plan and finish their projects on time. A virtual representation of the progress will make our app more entertaining and practical for people to notice where they are at in the project timeline, as well as if they are on track or behind.
